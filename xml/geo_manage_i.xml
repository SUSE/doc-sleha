  Before booth can manage a certain ticket within the &geo; cluster, you
  initially need to grant it to a site manually&mdash;either with the booth
  command line client or with &hawk2;.

  <title>Managing Tickets From Command Line</title>

  <remark>toms 2018-06-14: there is no "booth client" subcommand. According
   to the booth(8) manpage:
   "Whether the binary is called as boothd or booth doesnâ€™t matter; the first
   argument determines the mode of operation."

   SYNOPSIS:
     boothd daemon
     booth (list|grant|revoke|peers|status) ...

   So only boothd has a subcommand daemon, but booth has no subcommand client.
   Correct?
  </remark>
  <para>
   Use the <command>booth</command> command line tool to grant,
   list, or revoke tickets as described in
   <xref linkend="vl.ha.booth.client.cmds"/>. The
   <command>booth&nbsp;client</command> commands can be run on any machine in
   the cluster, not only the ones having the &boothd; running. The
   <command>booth&nbsp;client</command> commands try to find the
   <quote>local</quote> cluster by looking at the booth configuration file and
   the locally defined IP addresses. If you do not specify a site which the
   booth client should connect to (using the <option>-s</option> option), it
   will always connect to the local site.
  </para>

  <remark>toms 2018-06-14: Is this note still correct/useful?</remark>
  <note>
   <title>Syntax Changes</title>
   <para>
    The syntax of booth client commands has been simplified since &productname;
    11. The former syntax is still supported. For detailed information, see the
    <literal>Synopsis</literal> section in the booth man page.
   </para>
   <para>
    The examples in this manual use the simplified syntax.

     <para>
      In this case, <literal>&ticket1;</literal> will be granted to the site
      <literal>192.168.201.100</literal>. Without the <option>-s</option>
      option, booth would automatically connect to the current site (the site
      you are running the booth client on) and would request the
      <command>grant</command> operation.
     </para>
     <para>
      Before granting a ticket, the command executes a sanity check. If the
      same ticket is already granted to another site, you are warned about that
      and are prompted to revoke the ticket from the current site first.

booth[27900]: 2014/08/13_10:21:23 info: revoke succeeded!</screen>
     <para>
      Booth checks to which site the ticket is currently granted and requests
      the <command>revoke</command> operation for <literal>&ticket1;</literal>.
      The revoke operation will be executed immediately.

    </listitem>

  </variablelist>

  <para>
   The <command>grant</command> and (under certain circumstances),
   <command>revoke</command> operations may take a while to return a definite
   operation's outcome. The client waits for the result up to the ticket's
   <varname>timeout</varname> value before it gives up waiting. If the
   <option>-w</option> option was used, the client will wait indefinitely
   instead. Find the exact status in the log files or with the
   <command>crm_ticket -L</command> command.
  </para>
  <para>
   The <command>grant</command> command can take a <option>-F</option> option.
   This option is potentially dangerous, but it can be useful for manual
   ticket management in case a site which holds a ticket cannot be reached.
   It makes booth grant the ticket immediately to the specified site, even
   though booth cannot ascertain that other sites (that cannot be reached)
   do not hold the same ticket. It is up to the cluster administrator
   to resolve this situation once the other site is reachable again.
  </para>

  <warning>
   <title>Concurrency Violation and Potential Loss of Data</title>
   <para>
    Before you use this option, make sure that no other site currently owns
    the same ticket. If the same ticket is granted to multiple sites,
    resources depending on the ticket might be started on multiple sites in
    parallel, resulting in concurrency violation and potential data
    corruption.
   </para>
  </warning>

  <remark>toms 2018-06-15: Is the following warning really necessary?
   Do we still use crm_ticket?
  </remark>
  <warning>
   <title><command>crm_ticket</command> and <command>crm&nbsp;site&nbsp;ticket</command></title>
   <para>
    If the booth service is not running for any reasons, you may also manage
    tickets manually with <command>crm_ticket</command> or
    <command>crm&nbsp;site&nbsp;ticket</command>. Both commands are only
    available on cluster nodes. Use them with great care as they
    <emphasis>cannot</emphasis> verify if the same ticket is already granted
    elsewhere. For more information, read the man pages.
   </para>
   <para>
    As long as booth is up and running, only use the
    <command>booth</command> for manual intervention.

  <remark>toms 2018-06-15: Chris, we need to rewrite this procedure
    to a more realistic user scenario?
    Ticket is granted to one site which is now offline. How to grant the
    ticket to the second second site and to revoke the ticket from the first
    site?
