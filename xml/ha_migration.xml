      <abstract>
        <para>
    This chapter covers two different scenarios: upgrading a cluster to
    another version of &productname; (either a major release or a service
    pack) as opposed to updating individual packages on cluster nodes. See
    <xref linkend="sec-ha-migration-upgrade"/> versus
    <xref linkend="sec-ha-migration-update"/>.
   </para>
        <para>
    If you want to upgrade your cluster, check
    <xref linkend="sec-ha-migration-upgrade-oview"/> and
    <xref linkend="sec-ha-migration-upgrade-require"/> before starting
    to upgrade.

    <listitem>
     <para>
      A major release is a new product version that brings new features and
      tools, and decommissions previously deprecated components. It comes with
      backward incompatible changes.

      If a new product version includes major changes that are backward
      incompatible, the cluster needs to be upgraded by a cluster offline
      upgrade. You need to take all nodes offline and upgrade the cluster as a whole,
      before you can bring all nodes back online.

      In a cluster rolling upgrade one cluster node at a time is upgraded while the
      rest of the cluster is still running. You take the first node offline,
      upgrade it and bring it back online to join the cluster. Then you

    <title>Skipping service packs</title>
    <para>
     The easiest upgrade path is consecutively installing all service packs. For
     the &sle;&nbsp;&product-ga; product line (GA and the subsequent service
     packs), skipping up to two service packs is also supported when upgrading.
     For example, upgrading from &productnameshort;&nbsp;15&nbsp;SP3 to 15&nbsp;SP6 is
     supported (as long as &productnameshort;&nbsp;15&nbsp;SP3 is supported).

       If none of the situations above apply, you do not need to stop the
       cluster stack. In that case, put the node into maintenance mode
       before starting the software update:
      </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;<command>crm node maintenance <replaceable>NODE_NAME</replaceable></command></screen>
      <para>
       For more details on maintenance mode, see

     Install the package update using either &yast; or Zypper.

     After the update has been successfully installed:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Either start the cluster stack on the respective node (if you
       stopped it in <xref linkend="step-update-check"/>):
      </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;<command>crm cluster start</command></screen>
     </listitem>

       or remove the maintenance flag to bring the node back to
       normal mode:

<screen>&prompt.root;<command>crm node ready <replaceable>NODE_NAME</replaceable></command></screen>
     </listitem>
