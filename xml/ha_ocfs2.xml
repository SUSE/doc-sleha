        <para>
    Oracle Cluster File System 2 (&ocfs;) is a general-purpose journaling
    file system that has been fully integrated since the Linux 2.6 Kernel.
    &ocfs; allows you to store application binary files, data files, and
    databases on devices on shared storage. All nodes in a cluster have
    concurrent read and write access to the file system. A user-space
    control daemon, managed via a clone resource, provides the integration
    with the HA stack, in particular with &corosync; and the Distributed
    Lock Manager (DLM).

   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     File access is coordinated through DLM. DLM control is good for most

  <title>Configuring &ocfs; Services and a &stonith; Resource</title>

<!--https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=520714-->

  <para>
   Before you can create &ocfs; volumes, you must configure the following
   resources as services in the cluster: DLM, and a &stonith; resource.
   &ocfs; uses the cluster membership services from Pacemaker which run
   in user space. Therefore, DLM needs to be configured as clone resource
   that is present on each node in the cluster.
  </para>

  <para>
   The following procedure uses the <command>crm</command> shell to
   configure the cluster resources. Alternatively, you can also use
   &hawk; to configure the resources as described in
   <xref linkend="sec.ha.ocfs2.rsc.hawk"/>.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>DLM Resource for Both cLVM and &ocfs;</title>

    Both cLVM and &ocfs; need a DLM resource that runs on all nodes in

    <emphasis>one</emphasis> DLM resource for both &ocfs; and cLVM is

    The configuration consists of a base group that includes several
    primitives and a base clone. Both base group and base clone can be used
    in various scenarios afterwards (for both &ocfs; and cLVM, for
    example). You only need to extended the base group with the respective
    primitives as needed. As the base group has internal colocation and
    ordering, this simplifies the overall setup as you do not need to
    specify several individual groups, clones and their dependencies.

        The maximum number of nodes that can concurrently mount a volume.

   <para>
    To mount an &ocfs; volume with the &ha; software, configure an

    the <command>crm</command> shell to configure the cluster resources.

    <para>The <command>add</command> subcommand appends the new group

  <title>Using Quotas on &ocfs; File Systems</title>

<!--taroth 2011-11-24: fate#310056: the following section is a stub, based on an old RN
   entry,  todo: extend for next revision-->

  <para>
   To use quotas on an &ocfs; file system, create and mount the files
   system with the appropriate quota features or mount options,
   respectively: <literal>ursquota</literal> (quota for individual users) or
   <literal>grpquota</literal> (quota for groups). These features can also
   be enabled later on an unmounted file system using
   <command>tunefs.ocfs2</command>.
  </para>

  <para>
   When a file system has the appropriate quota feature enabled, it tracks
   in its metadata how much space and files each user (or group) uses. Since
   &ocfs; treats quota information as file system-internal metadata, you
   do not need to run the <command>quotacheck</command>(8) program. All
   functionality is built into fsck.ocfs2 and the file system driver itself.
  </para>

  <para>
   To enable enforcement of limits imposed on each user or group, run
   <command>quotaon</command>(8) like you would do for any other file
   system.
  </para>

<!--taroth 2011-11-26: according to jan kara (jack), the limitations for
   repquota and warnquota are now obsolete with solving fate#310056, thus
   removing the following completely-->

<!--<para>
   With &ocfs; file systems, the following commands work as usual:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     quota(1)
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     setquota(8)
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     edquota(8)
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>
     Because of a limitation in the current Kernel interface, the following
   commands do not work with &ocfs;:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     repquota(8)
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     warnquota(8)
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>-->

  <para>
   For performance reasons each cluster node performs quota accounting
   locally and synchronizes this information with a common central storage
   once per 10 seconds. This interval is tunable with
   <command>tunefs.ocfs2</command>, options
   <option>usrquota-sync-interval</option> and
   <option>grpquota-sync-interval</option>. Therefore quota information may
   not be exact at all times and as a consequence users or groups can
   slightly exceed their quota limit when operating on several cluster nodes
   in parallel.
