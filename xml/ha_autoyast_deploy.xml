  <title>Deploying nodes with &ay;</title>
  <info>
    <abstract>
      <para>
        After you have installed and set up a two-node cluster, you can extend the
        cluster by cloning existing nodes with &ay; and adding the clones to the cluster.
      </para>
      <para>&ay; uses profiles that contains installation and configuration data.
        A profile tells &ay; what to install and how to configure the installed system to
        get a ready-to-use system in the end. This profile can then be used
        for mass deployment in different ways (for example, to clone existing cluster nodes).
      </para>
      <para>
        For detailed instructions on how to use &ay; in various scenarios, see the

     out &productname; &productnumber; to a set of machines with identical hardware
     configurations.

     If you need to deploy cluster nodes on non-identical hardware, refer to the

    <substeps performance="required">
     <step>
      <para>
       Creating an &ay; profile. Use the &ay; GUI to create and modify
       a profile based on the existing system configuration. In &ay;,
       choose the <guimenu>&ha;</guimenu> module and click the
       <guimenu>Clone</guimenu> button. If needed, adjust the configuration
       in the other modules and save the resulting control file as XML.
      </para>
      <para>
       If you have configured DRBD, you can select and clone this module in
       the &ay; GUI, too.

  <para>
   After the clone has been successfully installed, execute the following
   steps to make the cloned node join the cluster:
  </para>

  <procedure xml:id="pro-ha-installation-clone-start">
   <title>Bringing the cloned node online</title>
   <step>
    <para>
     Transfer the key configuration files from the already configured nodes
     to the cloned node with &csync; as described in
     <xref linkend="sec-ha-installation-setup-csync2"/>.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     To bring the node online, start the cluster services on the cloned
     node as described in <xref linkend="sec-ha-installation-start"/>.
    </para>
   </step>
  </procedure>

  <para>
   The cloned node now joins the cluster because the
   <filename>/etc/corosync/corosync.conf</filename> file has been applied to
   the cloned node via &csync;. The CIB is automatically synchronized
   among the cluster nodes.
