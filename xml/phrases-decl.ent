  <listitem>
   <para>
    The cluster on each site has a meaningful name, for example:
    <literal>&cluster1;</literal> and <literal>&cluster2;</literal>.
   </para>
   <para>
    The cluster names for each site are defined in the respective
    &corosync.conf; files:
   </para>
<screen>totem {
    [...]
    cluster_name: &cluster1;
    }
</screen>
   <para>
    This can either be done manually (by editing &corosync.conf;) or with the
    &yast; cluster module (by switching to the <guimenu>Communication
    Channels</guimenu> category and defining a <guimenu>Cluster
    Name</guimenu>). Afterward, stop and start the <systemitem
    class='service'>pacemaker</systemitem> service for the changes to take effect:
   </para> <screen>&prompt.root;<command>systemctl</command> stop pacemaker
&prompt.root;<command>systemctl</command> start pacemaker</screen>
  </listitem>
