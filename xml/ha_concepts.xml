  <abstract>
   <para>
    &productnamereg; is an integrated suite of open source clustering
    technologies. It enables you to implement highly available physical and
    virtual Linux clusters, and to eliminate single points of failure. It
    ensures the high availability and manageability of critical network
    resources including data, applications, and services. Thus, it helps you
    maintain business continuity, protect data integrity, and reduce
    unplanned downtime for your mission-critical Linux workloads.
   </para>
   <para>
    It ships with essential monitoring, messaging, and cluster resource
    management functionality (supporting failover, failback, and migration
    (load balancing) of individually managed cluster resources).
   </para>
   <para>
    This chapter introduces the main product features and benefits of the
    &hasi;. Inside you will find several example clusters and learn about
    the components making up a cluster. The last section provides an
    overview of the architecture, describing the individual architecture
    layers and processes within the cluster.

    Your cluster can contain up to 32 Linux servers. Using 
    &pmrm;, the cluster can be extended to include
    additional Linux servers beyond this limit.
    Any server in the cluster can restart resources (applications, services, IP
    addresses, and file systems) from a failed server in the cluster.

    The &hasi; ships with &corosync; messaging and membership layer
    and Pacemaker Cluster Resource Manager. Using Pacemaker, administrators
    can continually monitor the health and status of their resources, and manage
    dependencies. They can automatically stop and start services based on highly
    configurable rules and policies. The &hasi; allows you to tailor a
    cluster to the specific applications and hardware infrastructure that
    fit your organization. Time-dependent configuration enables services to
    automatically migrate back to repaired nodes at specified times.

   <title>Storage and data replication</title>
   <para>
    With the &hasi; you can dynamically assign and reassign server
    storage as needed. It supports Fibre Channel or iSCSI storage area
    networks (SANs). Shared disk systems are also supported, but they are
    not a requirement. &productname; also comes with a cluster-aware file
    system (OCFS2) and the cluster Logical Volume Manager (cluster LVM2).
    For replication of your data, use DRBD* to mirror the data of
    a &ha; service from the active node of a cluster to its standby node.
    Furthermore, &productname; also supports CTDB (Cluster Trivial Database),
    a technology for Samba clustering.

       Multiple, &geo.dispersed; sites with a local cluster each. The
       sites communicate via IP. Failover across the sites is coordinated by
       a higher-level entity. &geo; clusters need to cope with limited
       network bandwidth and high latency. Storage is replicated
       asynchronously.

  <title>Benefits</title>

  <para>
   The &hasi; allows you to configure up to 32 Linux servers into a
   high-availability cluster (HA cluster). Resources can be
   dynamically switched or moved to any node in the cluster. Resources can
   be configured to automatically migrate if a node fails, or they can be
   moved manually to troubleshoot hardware or balance the workload.
  </para>

  <para>
   The &hasi; provides high availability from commodity components. Lower
   costs are obtained through the consolidation of applications and
   operations onto a cluster. The &hasi; also allows you to centrally
   manage the complete cluster. You can adjust resources to meet changing
   workload requirements (thus, manually <quote>load balance</quote> the
   cluster). Allowing clusters of more than two nodes also provides savings
   by allowing several nodes to share a <quote>hot spare</quote>.
  </para>

  <para>
   An equally important benefit is the potential reduction of unplanned
   service outages and planned outages for software and hardware
   maintenance and upgrades.

  <bridgehead>Example cluster scenario</bridgehead>

  <para>
   Suppose you have configured a three-node cluster, with a Web server
   installed on each of the three nodes in the cluster. Each of the
   nodes in the cluster hosts two Web sites. All the data, graphics, and
   Web page content for each Web site are stored on a shared disk subsystem
   connected to each of the nodes in the cluster. The following figure
   depicts how this setup might look.

   During normal cluster operation, each node is in constant communication
   with the other nodes in the cluster and performs periodic polling of
   all registered resources to detect failure.

   Suppose Web Server 1 experiences hardware or software problems and the
   users depending on Web Server 1 for Internet access, e-mail, and
   information lose their connections. The following figure shows how
   resources are moved when Web Server 1 fails.

  <para>
   Web Site A moves to Web Server 2 and Web Site B moves to Web Server 3. IP
   addresses and certificates also move to Web Server 2 and Web Server 3.
  </para>

  <para>
   When you configured the cluster, you decided where the Web sites hosted
   on each Web server would go should a failure occur. In the previous
   example, you configured Web Site A to move to Web Server 2 and Web Site B
   to move to Web Server 3. This way, the workload formerly handled by Web
   Server 1 continues to be available and is evenly distributed between any
   surviving cluster members.
  </para>

  <para>
   When Web Server 1 failed, the &hasi; software did the following:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     Detected a failure and verified with &stonith; that Web Server 1 was
     really dead. &stonith; is an acronym for <quote>Shoot The Other Node
     In The Head</quote>. It is a means of bringing down misbehaving nodes
     to prevent them from causing trouble in the cluster.

  <para>
   In this example, the failover process happened quickly and users regained
   access to Web site information within seconds, usually without needing to
   log in again.
  </para>

  <para>
   Now suppose the problems with Web Server 1 are resolved, and Web Server 1
   is returned to a normal operating state. Web Site A and Web Site B can
   either automatically fail back (move back) to Web Server 1, or they can
   stay where they are. This depends on how you configured the resources for
   them. Migrating the services back to Web Server 1 will incur some
   down-time. Therefore the &hasi; also allows you to defer the migration until
   a period when it will cause little or no service interruption. There are
   advantages and disadvantages to both alternatives.
  </para>

  <para>
   The &hasi; also provides resource migration capabilities. You can move
   applications, Web sites, etc. to other servers in your cluster as
   required for system management.
  </para>

  <para>
   For example, you could have manually moved Web Site A or Web Site B from
   Web Server 1 to either of the other servers in the cluster. Use cases for
   this are upgrading or performing scheduled maintenance on Web Server 1,
   or increasing performance or accessibility of the Web sites.
  </para>
 </sect1>
 <sect1 xml:id="sec-ha-clusterconfig">
  <title>Cluster configurations: storage</title>

  <para>
   Cluster configurations with the &hasi; might or might not include a
   shared disk subsystem. The shared disk subsystem can be connected via
   high-speed Fibre Channel cards, cables, and switches, or it can be
   configured to use iSCSI. If a node fails, another designated node in
   the cluster automatically mounts the shared disk directories that were
   previously mounted on the failed node. This gives network users
   continuous access to the directories on the shared disk subsystem.
  </para>

  <important>
   <title>Shared disk subsystem with LVM2</title>
   <para>
    When using a shared disk subsystem with LVM2, that subsystem must be

         On every node, Pacemaker maintains the cluster information database
         (CIB). It is an XML representation of the cluster configuration
         (including cluster options, nodes, resources, constraints and the
         relationship to each other). The CIB also reflects the current cluster
         status. Each cluster node contains a CIB replica, which is synchronized
         across the whole cluster. The <systemitem class="daemon">pacemaker-based</systemitem>
         daemon takes care of reading and writing cluster configuration and
         status.</para>

        The DC is elected from all nodes in the cluster. This happens if there
        is no DC yet or if the current DC leaves the cluster for any reason.
        The DC is the only entity in the cluster that can decide that a
        cluster-wide change needs to be performed, such as fencing a node or
        moving resources around. All other nodes get their configuration and
        resource allocation information from the current DC.

        The policy engine runs on every node, but the one on the DC is the active
        one. The engine is implemented as
        <systemitem class="daemon">pacemaker-schedulerd</systemitem> daemon.
        When a cluster transition is needed, based on the current state and
        configuration, <systemitem class="daemon">pacemaker-schedulerd</systemitem>
        calculates the expected next state of the cluster. It determines what
        actions need to be scheduled to achieve the next state.

     In a &ha; cluster, the services that need to be highly available are
     called resources. Resource agents (RAs) are scripts that start, stop, and

    The <systemitem class="daemon">pacemakerd</systemitem> daemon launches and
    monitors all other related daemons. The daemon that coordinates all actions,
    <systemitem class="daemon">pacemaker-controld</systemitem>, has an instance on
    each cluster node. Pacemaker centralizes all cluster decision-making by
    electing one of those instances as a master. Should the elected <systemitem
    class="daemon">pacemaker-controld</systemitem> daemon fail, a new one is
    established.

    Many actions performed in the cluster will cause a cluster-wide change.
    These actions can include things like adding or removing a cluster
    resource or changing resource constraints. It is important to understand
    what happens in the cluster when you perform such an action.
   </para>
   <para>
    For example, suppose you want to add a cluster IP address resource. To
    do this, you can use the &crmshell; or the Web interface to modify the CIB.
    It is not required to perform the actions on the DC.
    You can use either tool on any node in the cluster and they will be
    relayed to the DC. The DC will then replicate the CIB change to all
    cluster nodes.
   </para>
   <para>
    Based on the information in the CIB, the <systemitem
    class="daemon">pacemaker-schedulerd</systemitem> then computes the ideal
    state of the cluster and how it should be achieved. It feeds a list of
    instructions to the DC. The DC sends commands via the messaging/infrastructure
    layer which are received by the <systemitem
    class="daemon">pacemaker-controld</systemitem> peers on
    other nodes. Each of them uses its local resource agent executor (implemented
    as <systemitem class="daemon">pacemaker-execd</systemitem>) to perform
    resource modifications. The <systemitem
     class="daemon">pacemaker-execd</systemitem> is not cluster-aware and interacts
    directly with resource agents.
   </para>
   <para>
    All peer nodes report the results of their operations back to the DC.
    After the DC concludes that all necessary operations are successfully
    performed in the cluster, the cluster will go back to the idle state and
    wait for further events. If any operation was not carried out as
    planned, the <systemitem class="daemon">pacemaker-schedulerd</systemitem>
    is invoked again with the new information recorded in
    the CIB.

    In some cases, it may be necessary to power off nodes to protect shared
    data or complete resource recovery. In a Pacemaker cluster, the implementation
    of node level fencing is &stonith;. For this, Pacemaker comes with a
    fencing subsystem, <systemitem class="daemon">pacemaker-fenced</systemitem>.
    &stonith; devices have to be configured as cluster resources (that use
    specific fencing agents), because this allows to monitor the fencing devices.
    When clients detect a failure, they send a request to <systemitem
     class="daemon">pacemaker-fenced</systemitem>,
    which then executes the fencing agent to bring down the node.
