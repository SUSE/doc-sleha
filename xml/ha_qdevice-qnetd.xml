            a configurable number of votes, so allowing a cluster

            allow. We strongly recommend deploying <systemitem class="daemon">corosync-qnetd</systemitem> and <systemitem class="daemon">corosync-qdevice</systemitem> for two-node clusters, but using &qnet; and &qdevice; is also recommended in general for clusters with an even number of nodes.

                  &qdevice; supports different algorithms, which determine the behavior
                  of how votes are assigned.
                  Currently, the following exist:

                        FFSplit (<quote>fifty-fifty split</quote>) is the default. It is used
                        for clusters with an even number of nodes. If the cluster splits
                        into two similar partitions, this algorithm provides one vote to one of
                        the partitions, based on the results of heuristics checks and
                        other factors.

                        remaining node that can see the &qnet; server to get the votes.
                        So this algorithm is useful when a cluster with only one
                        active node should remain quorate.

                  &qdevice; supports a set of commands (<quote>heuristics</quote>).
                  The commands are executed locally on start-up of cluster services,
                  cluster membership change, successful connection to <systemitem
                  class="daemon">corosync-qnetd</systemitem>, or, optionally, at
                  regular times.
                  The heuristics can be set with the <parameter>quorum.device.heuristics</parameter>
                  key (in the <filename>corosync.conf</filename> file) or with the
                  <option>--qdevice-heuristics-mode</option> option.
                  Both know the values <literal>off</literal> (default),
                  <literal>sync</literal>, and <literal>on</literal>.
                  The difference between <literal>sync</literal> and <literal>on</literal>
                  is that you can additionally execute the above commands regularly.

               <para>
                  Only if all commands are executed successfully are the heuristics
                  considered to have passed; otherwise, they failed. The heuristics' result is
                  sent to <systemitem class="daemon">corosync-qnetd</systemitem> where
                  it is used in calculations to determine which partition should be quorate.

               It is recommended for &qdevice; to reach the &qnet; server.
               Ideally, the &qnet; server should be in a separate rack than the

      <title>Setting up a &qdevice; with heuristics</title>
      <para>
         If you need additional control over how votes are determined, use heuristics.
         Heuristics are a set of commands that are executed in parallel.
      </para>
      <para>
         For this purpose, the command <command>crm cluster init qdevice</command>

         pass one or more commands (separated by semicolons) with absolute paths.
      </para>
      <para>
         For example, if your own command for heuristic checks is located at
         <filename>/usr/sbin/my-script.sh</filename> you can run it on
         one of your cluster nodes as follows:
      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.root;<command>crm</command
> cluster init qdevice --qdevice-hostname=&node3; \
     --qdevice-heuristics=/usr/sbin/my-script.sh  \
     --qdevice-heuristics-mode=on</screen>
      <para>
         The command or commands can be written in any language such as Shell, Python, or Ruby.
         If they succeed, they return <literal>0</literal> (zero), otherwise they return an error code.
      </para>
      <para>
         You can also pass a set of commands. Only when all commands finish successfully (return
         code is zero), have the heuristics passed.
      </para>
      <para>
         The <option>--qdevice-heuristics-mode=on</option> option lets the heuristics
