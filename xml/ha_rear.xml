   <title>What Does Disaster Recovery Mean?</title>
   <para>
    If a system in a production environment has been destroyed (for whatever
    reasons&mdash;be it broken hardware, a misconfiguration or software
    problems), you need to re-create the system. The recreation can be done
    either on the same hardware or on compatible replacement hardware.
    Re-creating a system means more than restoring files from a backup.
    It also includes preparing the system's storage (with regard to partitioning, file
    systems, and mount points), and reinstalling the boot
    loader.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec.ha.rear.concept.basics">
   <title>How Does Disaster Recovery With &rear; Work?</title>
   <para>
    While the system is up and running, create a backup of the files and
    create a recovery system on a recovery medium. The recovery system
    contains a recovery installer.
   </para>
   <para>
    In case the system has been destroyed, replace broken hardware (if
    needed), boot the recovery system from the recovery medium and launch
    the recovery installer. The recovery installer re-creates the system:
    First, it prepares the storage (partitioning, file systems, mount
    points), then it restores the files from the backup. Finally, it
    reinstalls the boot loader.

        and restored as usual with file-based backup software.
       </para>
      </warning>
      <para>
       While recent snapshot subvolumes on Btrfs file systems need
       almost no disk space (because of Btrfs's copy-on-write functionality),
       those files would be backed up as complete files when using
       file-based backup software. They would end up twice in the backup
       with their original file size. Therefore, it is impossible to
       restore the snapshots as they have been before on the original
       system.
      </para>
<!-- from: https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Disaster_Recovery#btrfs -->
<!--<para>The main reason is: When there are btrfs snapshot subvolumes and you
        run usual file-based backup software (for example,
        <command>tar</command>) to back up the whole
        data of the btrfs filesystem then all what there is in snapshot
        subvolumes gets backed up as complete files. For example if there is
        a 8GB disk with a Btrfs filesystem where 5GB disk space is used and there
        is a recent snapshot. A recent snapshot needs almost no disk space
        because of btrfs' copy on write functionality. But 'tar' would create a
        backup that has an uncompressed size of about 10GB because the files
        appear twice: Under their regular path and additionally under the
        snapshot subvolume's path. It would be impossible to restore that tarball
        on the disk. This means btrfs snapshot subvolumes cannot be backed up and
        restored as usual with file-based backup software. </para>-->
