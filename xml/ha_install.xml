 <title>Installing the &hasi;</title>
 <info>
  <abstract>
   <para>If you set up an &ha; cluster with &productnamereg; for the first time, the
    easiest way is to start with a basic two-node cluster, which you can
    also use to run some tests. Afterward, you can add more
    nodes by cloning existing cluster nodes with &ay;. The cloned nodes will
    have the same packages installed and the same system configuration as the
    original ones.
   </para>
   <para>
    If you want to upgrade an existing cluster that runs an older version of 
    &productname;, refer to chapter <xref linkend="cha.ha.migration"/>.

  <title>Mass Installation and Deployment with &ay;</title>

  <para>
   After you have installed and set up a two-node cluster, you can extend the
   cluster by cloning existing nodes with &ay; and adding the clones to the cluster.
  </para>
   
   <para>&ay; uses profiles that contains installation and configuration data.
   A profile tells &ay; what to install and how to configure the installed system to
   get a ready-to-use system in the end. This profile can then be used
   for mass deployment in different ways (for example, to clone existing
   cluster nodes).</para>

   <para>
    For detailed instructions on how to use &ay; in various scenarios,
    see the <citetitle>&sle; &productnumber; &deploy;</citetitle>, available at
    <link xlink:href="http://www.suse.com/documentation/sle-12"/>. Refer to chapter
    <citetitle>Automated Installation</citetitle>.

    <title>Identical Hardware</title>
    <para>
     <xref linkend="pro.ha.installation.clone.node"/> assumes you are rolling
     out &productname; &productnumber; to a set of machines with identical hardware
     configurations.
    </para>
    <para>
     If you need to deploy cluster nodes on non-identical hardware, refer to the
     <citetitle>&sle; &productnumber; &deploy;</citetitle>,
     chapter <citetitle>Automated Installation</citetitle>, section
     <citetitle>Rule-Based Autoinstallation</citetitle>.

<!--from lmb on [ha-devel] 2010-02-19: 
    That wouldn't be included - that doesn't seem to be something that
    autoyast2 can do, since it installs only a node image, replicated
    configuration files are difficult.

    However, if you clone a base install using autoyast2, I'd expect (I've
    not tested this myself!) that with SP1, it comes up to the state where
    it can receive files via csync2 from the already configured nodes, which
   should get it to the state where it can automatically join the cluster.-->
