        <para>
    The &ha; cluster stack's highest priority is protecting the integrity
    of data. This is achieved by preventing uncoordinated concurrent access
    to data storage: For example, Ext3 file systems are only mounted once in
    the cluster, OCFS2 volumes will not be mounted unless coordination with
    other cluster nodes is available. In a well-functioning cluster
    Pacemaker will detect if resources are active beyond their concurrency
    limits and initiate recovery. Furthermore, its policy engine will never
    exceed these limitations.
   </para>
        <para>
    However, network partitioning or software malfunction could potentially
    cause scenarios where several coordinators are elected. If this
    so-called split brain scenarios were allowed to unfold, data corruption
    might occur. Hence, several layers of protection have been added to the
    cluster stack to mitigate this.
   </para>
        <para>
    The primary component contributing to this goal is IO
    fencing/&stonith; since it ensures that all other access prior to
    storage activation is terminated. Other mechanisms are cLVM2 exclusive
    activation or OCFS2 file locking support to protect your system against
    administrative or application faults. Combined appropriately for your
    setup, these can reliably prevent split brain scenarios from causing
    harm.
   </para>
        <para>
    This chapter describes an IO fencing mechanism that leverages the
    storage itself, followed by the description of an additional layer of
    protection to ensure exclusive storage access. These two mechanisms can
    be combined for higher levels of protection.

  <title>Storage-based Fencing</title>

  <para>
   You can reliably avoid split brain scenarios by using one or more
   &stonith; Block Devices (SBD), <literal>watchdog</literal> support and
   the <literal>external/sbd</literal> &stonith; agent.
  </para>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec.ha.storage.protect.fencing.oview">
   <title>Overview</title>
   <para>
    In an environment where all nodes have access to shared storage, a small
    partition of the device is formatted for use with SBD. The size of the
    partition depends on the block size of the used disk (1&nbsp;MB for
    standard SCSI disks with 512&nbsp;Byte block size; DASD disks with
    4&nbsp;kB block size need 4&nbsp;MB). After the respective daemon
    is configured, it is brought online on each node before the rest of the
    cluster stack is started. It is terminated after all other cluster
    components have been shut down, thus ensuring that cluster resources are
    never activated without SBD supervision.
   </para>
   <para>
    The daemon automatically allocates one of the message slots on the
    partition to itself, and constantly monitors it for messages addressed
    to itself. Upon receipt of a message, the daemon immediately complies
    with the request, such as initiating a power-off or reboot cycle for
    fencing.
   </para>
   <para>
    The daemon constantly monitors connectivity to the storage device, and
    terminates itself in case the partition becomes unreachable. This
    guarantees that it is not disconnected from fencing messages. If the
    cluster data resides on the same logical unit in a different partition,
    this is not an additional point of failure: The work-load will terminate
    anyway if the storage connectivity has been lost.
   </para>
   <para>
    Increased protection is offered through <literal>watchdog</literal>
    support. Modern systems support a <literal>hardware watchdog</literal>
    that needs to be <quote>tickled</quote> or <quote>fed</quote> by a
    software component. The software component (usually a daemon) regularly
    writes a service pulse to the watchdog&mdash;if the daemon stops
    feeding the watchdog, the hardware will enforce a system restart. This
    protects against failures of the SBD process itself, such as dying, or
    becoming stuck on an IO error.
   </para>
   <para>
    If Pacemaker integration is activated, SBD will not self-fence if device
    majority is lost. For example, your cluster contains 3 nodes: A, B, and
    C. Because of a network split, A can only see itself while B and C can
    still communicate. In this case, there are two cluster partitions, one
    with quorum because of being the majority (B, C), and one without (A).
    If this happens while the majority of fencing devices are unreachable,
    node A would immediately commit suicide, but the nodes B and C would
    continue to run.

       SBD will not terminate itself if it loses access to one mirror leg,
       allowing the cluster to continue. However, since SBD does not have
       enough knowledge to detect an asymmetric split of the storage, it
       will not fence the other side while only one mirror leg is available.
       Thus, it cannot automatically tolerate a second failure while one of
       the storage arrays is down.

       messages can be successfully be transmitted if at least two devices
       are still accessible.

      <para>
       This configuration is suitable for more complex scenarios where
       storage is not restricted to a single array. Host-based mirroring

    <title>Creating the SBD Partition</title>
    <para>
     It is recommended to create a 1MB partition at the start of the device.
     If your SBD device resides on a multipath group, you need to adjust the
     timeouts SBD uses, as MPIO's path down detection can cause some
     latency. After the <literal>msgwait</literal> timeout, the message is
     assumed to have been delivered to the node. For multipath, this should
     be the time required for MPIO to detect a path failure and switch to
     the next path. You may need to test this in your environment. The node
     will terminate itself if the SBD daemon running on it has not updated
     the watchdog timer fast enough. Test your chosen timeouts in your
     specific environment. In case you use a multipath storage with just one
     SBD device, pay special attention to the failover delays incurred.

    <important>
     <title>Accessing the Watchdog Timer</title>
     <para>
      No other software must access the watchdog timer. Some hardware

    <para>
     In &productname;, watchdog support in the Kernel is enabled by
     default: It ships with several different Kernel modules that provide
     hardware-specific watchdog drivers. The &hasi; uses the SBD daemon
     as software component that <quote>feeds</quote> the watchdog. If
     configured as described in
     <xref linkend="pro.ha.storage.protect.sbd.daemon"/>, the SBD daemon
     will start automatically when the respective node is brought online
     with <command>systemctl</command> <option>start
     pacemaker.service</option>.
    </para>
    <para>
     Usually, the appropriate watchdog driver for your hardware is
     automatically loaded during system boot. <literal>softdog</literal> is
     the most generic driver, but it is recommended to use a driver with
     actual hardware integration. For example:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       On HP hardware, this is the <systemitem>hpwdt</systemitem> driver.

     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       For systems with an Intel TCO, the <literal>iTCO_wdt</literal> driver
       can be used.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
     For a list of choices, refer to
     <filename>/usr/src/<replaceable>KERNEL_VERSION</replaceable>/drivers/watchdog</filename>.
     Alternatively, list the drivers that have been installed with your
     Kernel version with the following command:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;<command>rpm</command> -ql kernel-<replaceable>VERSION</replaceable> | <command>grep</command> watchdog</screen>
    <para>
     As most watchdog driver names contain strings like
     <literal>wd</literal>, <literal>wdt</literal>, or
     <literal>dog</literal>, use the following command to check which driver
     is currently loaded:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;<command>lsmod</command> | <command>egrep</command> "(wd|dog)" </screen>
    <para>
     To automatically load the watchdog driver, create the file
     <filename>/etc/modules-load.d/watchdog.conf</filename> containing a
     line with the driver name. For more information refer to the man page
     <literal>modules-load.d</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
     The minimum allowed value for the emulated watchdog is
     <literal>15</literal> seconds.
     If you change the timeout for watchdog, the other two values
     (<literal>msgwait</literal> and <literal>stonith-timeout</literal>)
     must be changed as well. The watchdog timeout depends mostly on your
     storage latency. This value specifies that the majority of devices must
     successfully finish their read operation within this time frame. If
     not, the node will self-fence.
    </para>
    <para>
     The following <quote>formula</quote> expresses roughly this
     relationship between these three values:

    </example>
    <para>
     For example, if you set the timeout watchdog to 120, you need to set

      <title>&stonith; Configuration for 2-Node Clusters</title>
      <para>In two-node clusters (and other clusters where
       <literal>no-quorum-policy</literal> is set to <literal>ignore</literal>),
       mistimed fencing occurs quite frequently, because both nodes will try to
       fence each other in case of a split-brain situation. To avoid this double
       fencing, <!--make use of a ping host, and -->add the
       <literal>pcmk_delay_max</literal> parameter to the configuration of the
       &stonith; resource. <!--If the ping host is not available, the fencing
        action will be delayed.--> This gives servers with a working network card a
       better chance to survive.</para>

       To complete the SBD setup, activate SBD as a &stonith;/fencing
       mechanism in the CIB as follows:

       The resource does not need to be cloned, as it would shut down the

<!-- bnc#891346 -->
       Which value to set for <literal>stonith-timeout</literal> depends on
       the <literal>msgwait</literal> timeout. The
       <literal>msgwait</literal> timeout should be longer than the maximum
       allowed timeout for the underlying IO system. For example, this is 30
       seconds for plain SCSI disks. Provided you set the
       <literal>msgwait</literal> timeout value to 30 seconds, setting
       <literal>stonith-timeout</literal> to 40 seconds is appropriate.
      </para>
<!--Use the following formula to set the minimum value of
        <literal>stonith-timeout</literal>:</para>
       <screen>stonith-timeout >= 1.2 * msgwait</screen>-->

       Since node slots are allocated automatically, no manual host list
       needs to be defined.

       Disable any other fencing devices you might have configured before,

    <para>
     After the resource has started, your cluster is successfully configured
     for shared-storage fencing and will use this method in case a node
     needs to be fenced.

  <title>Ensuring Exclusive Storage Activation</title>

  <para>
   This section introduces <literal>sfex</literal>, an additional low-level
   mechanism to lock access to shared storage exclusively to one node. Note
   that sfex does not replace &stonith;. Since sfex requires shared
   storage, it is recommended that the <literal>external/sbd</literal>
   fencing mechanism described above is used on another partition of the
   storage.
  </para>

  <para>
   By design, sfex cannot be used with workloads that require concurrency
   (such as OCFS2), but serves as a layer of protection for classic failover
   style workloads. This is similar to a SCSI-2 reservation in effect, but
   more general.

   <title>Overview</title>
   <para>
    In a shared storage environment, a small partition of the storage is set
    aside for storing one or more locks.
   </para>
   <para>
    Before acquiring protected resources, the node must first acquire the
    protecting lock. The ordering is enforced by Pacemaker, and the sfex
    component ensures that even if Pacemaker were subject to a split brain
    situation, the lock will never be granted more than once.
   </para>
   <para>
    These locks must also be refreshed periodically, so that a node's death
    does not permanently block the lock and other nodes can proceed.
