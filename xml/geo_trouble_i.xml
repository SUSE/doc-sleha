 <para> Booth <!--logs to <filename>/var/log/messages</filename> and -->
  uses the same logging mechanism as the CRM. Thus, changing the log level
  will also take effect on booth logging. The booth log messages also
  contain information about any tickets. </para>
 <para> Both the booth log messages and the booth configuration file are
  included in the <command>crm report</command>. </para>
 <para> In case of unexpected booth behavior or any problems, check the
  logging data with <command>sudo journalctl -n</command> or create a
  detailed cluster report with <command>crm report</command>. </para>
 <para> In case you can access the cluster nodes on all sites (plus the
  arbitrators) from one single host via SSH, it is possible to collect log
  files from all of them within the same <literal>crm report</literal>.
  When calling <command>crm
  report</command> with the
   <option>-n</option> option, it gets the log files from all hosts that
  you specify with <option>-n</option>. (Without <option>-n</option>, it
  would try to obtain the list of nodes from the respective cluster). For
  example, to create a single <literal>crm report</literal> that includes
  the log files from two two-node clusters
   (<literal>192.168.201.111</literal>|<literal>192.168.201.112</literal>
  and
   <literal>192.168.202.111</literal>|<literal>192.168.202.112</literal>)
  plus an arbitrator (<literal>147.2.207.14</literal>), use the following
  command: </para>
 <screen>&prompt.root; crm report -n "147.2.207.14 192.168.201.111 192.168.201.112 \
 192.168.202.111 192.168.202.112"  -f 10:00 -t 11:00 db-incident</screen>
 <para> If the issue is about booth only and you know on which cluster
  nodes (within a site) booth is running, then specify only those two
  nodes plus the arbitrator. </para>
 <para> If there is no way to access all sites from one host, run
  <command>crm
  report</command> individually on the arbitrator, and on
  the cluster nodes of the individual sites, specifying the same period of
  time. To collect the log files on an arbitrator, you must use the
   <option>-S</option> option for single node operation: </para>
 <screen>&cluster1; # crm report -f 10:00 -t 11:00 db-incident-&cluster1;
&cluster2; # crm report -f 10:00 -t 11:00 db-incident-&cluster2;
arbitrator # crm report -S -f 10:00 -t 11:00 db-incident-arbitrator</screen>
 <para> However, it is preferable to produce one single <literal>crm
   report</literal> for all machines that you need log files from. </para>
