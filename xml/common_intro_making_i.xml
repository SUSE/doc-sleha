 <title>About the Making of This Manual</title>

 <para>
  This book is written in Novdoc, a subset of DocBook (see
  <link xlink:href="http://www.docbook.org"/>). The XML source files were
  validated by <command>xmllint</command>, processed by
  <command>xsltproc</command>, and converted into XSL-FO using a customized
  version of Norman Walsh's stylesheets. The final PDF is formatted through
  XEP from RenderX. <phrase os="osuse">The open source tools and the
  environment used to build this manual are available in the package
  <systemitem class="resource">daps</systemitem> that is shipped with
  &productname;. The project's home page can be found at
  <link xlink:href="http://daps.sf.net/"/>.</phrase>
