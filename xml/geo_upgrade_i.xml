  <title>Upgrading from SLE&nbsp;HA&nbsp;11 SP3 to SLE&nbsp;HA&nbsp;12</title>

   The former booth version (v0.1) was based on the Paxos algorithm. The
   current booth version (v0.2) is loosely based on raft and is incompatible
   with the one running v0.1. Therefore, rolling upgrades are not possible.
   Because of the new multi-tenancy feature, the new arbitrator init script
   cannot stop or test the status of the Paxos v0.1 arbitrator. On upgrade
   to v0.2, the arbitrator will be stopped, if running. The OCF
   resource-agent <literal>ocf:pacemaker:booth-site</literal> is capable of
   stopping and monitoring the booth v0.1 site daemon.

     As the syntax and the consensus algorithm for booth has changed, you
     need to update the booth configuration files to match the latest
     requirements. Previously you could optionally specify expiry time and
     weights by appending them to the ticket name with a semicolon
     (<literal>;</literal>) as separator. The new syntax has separate tokens
     for all ticket options. See <xref linkend="sec.ha.geo.booth"/> for
     details. If you did not specify expiry time or weights different from
     the defaults, and do not want to use the multi-tenancy feature, you can
     still use the old &booth.conf;.

  The SLE12 booth most probably cannot talk to the SLE11 booth,
  since the previous consensus algorythm (paxos) got replaced.
  
  Hence, it is more involved. The best way would be to take the
  booth completely out of picture during upgrade.
  
  The backup site can be upgraded without any special extra steps
  for GEO. The only thing not to forget is to convert the booth
  configuration.
  
  Of course, particular attention needs the active site, i.e. the
  site where the protected resources are currently running. I'd
  propose the following procedure for the active site:
  
  ==========
  
  1. Remove the dependency on the booth resource and on the
  ticket.
  
  Our GEO quick guide recommends adding an order constraint
  between the booth group and the protected resource:
  
  order order-booth-rsc1 inf: g-booth rsc1:promote
  
  That constraint should be removed. All rsc_ticket constraints
  should be removed too.
  
  The protected resource will continue to run uninterrupted.
  
  2. Upgrade booth on all arbitrators and modify the booth
  configuration to match the new format. Start booth on all
  arbitrators and make sure that it's running.
  
  3. Update the booth configuration files on all nodes at this
  site.
  
  4. Update the cluster stack and booth.
  
  5. Once the cluster stack and all resources are running, use
  booth list to verify that the ticket is still granted to this
  site. If it is not, then grant the ticket. Also verify that the
  arbitrators have booth list output consistent with the site.
  
  6. Add back the order and rsc_ticket constraints removed in
  step 1.
  
  ==========
  
  On the inactive site, we'll have just the booth configuration
  file modifications. The rest shouldn't matter. -->
