        <para>
    The main purpose of an HA cluster is to manage user services. Typical
    examples of user services are an Apache Web server or a database. From
    the user's point of view, the services do something specific when
    ordered to do so. To the cluster, however, they are only resources which
    may be started or stopped&mdash;the nature of the service is
    irrelevant to the cluster.
   </para>
        <para>
    This chapter introduces some basic concepts you need to know
    when administering your cluster. The following
    chapters show you how to execute the main configuration and
    administration tasks with each of the management tools &productname;
    provides.

  <title>Quorum determination</title>
  <para>
   Whenever communication fails between one or more nodes and the rest of the
   cluster, a cluster partition occurs. The nodes can only communicate with
   other nodes in the same partition and are unaware of the separated nodes.
   A cluster partition is defined as having quorum (being <quote>quorate</quote>)
   if it has the majority of nodes (or votes).
   How this is achieved is done by <emphasis>quorum calculation</emphasis>.
   Quorum is a requirement for fencing.
   </para>
   <para>
   Quorum is not calculated or determined by &pace;. &corosync; can handle quorum for
   two-node clusters directly without changing the &pace; configuration.
  </para>

  <para>How quorum is calculated is influenced by the following factors:</para>
   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry xml:id="vl-ha-config-basics-global-number-of-cluster-nodes">
     <term>Number of cluster nodes</term>
     <listitem>
         <para>To keep services running, a cluster with more than two nodes
       relies on quorum (majority vote) to resolve cluster partitions.
       Based on the following formula, you can calculate the minimum
       number of operational nodes required for the cluster to function:</para>
       <screen>N ≥ C/2 + 1

N = minimum number of operational nodes
C = number of cluster nodes</screen>
      <para>For example, a five-node cluster needs a minimum of three operational
       nodes (or two nodes which can fail). </para>
      <para>
       We strongly recommend to use either a two-node cluster or an odd number
       of cluster nodes.
       Two-node clusters make sense for stretched setups across two sites.
       Clusters with an odd number of nodes can either be built on one single
       site or might be spread across three sites.

       For example, in a five-node cluster every node has one vote and thus,

       When three or more nodes are visible to each other, the cluster

 <sect2 xml:id="sec-ha-config-basics-global-quorum">
  <title>Global option <literal>no-quorum-policy</literal></title>
  <para>
   This global option defines what to do when a cluster partition does not
   have quorum (no majority of nodes is part of the partition).
  </para>
  <para>
   The following values are available:
  </para>
  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term><literal>ignore</literal>
    </term>
    <listitem>
     <para/>
     <para>
      Setting <literal>no-quorum-policy</literal> to <literal>ignore</literal> makes
      a cluster partition behave like it has quorum, even if it does not. The cluster
      partition is allowed to issue fencing and continue resource management.
     </para>
     <para>
      On &slsa;&nbsp;11 this was the recommended setting for a two-node cluster.
      Starting with &slsa;&nbsp;12, the value <literal>ignore</literal> is obsolete
      and must not be used.
      Based on configuration and conditions, &corosync; gives cluster nodes
      or a single node <quote>quorum</quote>&mdash;or not.
     </para>
     <para>
     For two-node clusters the only meaningful behavior is to always
     react in case of node loss. The first step should always be
     to try to fence the lost node.

   <varlistentry>
    <term><literal>freeze</literal>
    </term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      If quorum is lost, the cluster partition freezes. Resource management
      is continued: running resources are not stopped (but possibly
      restarted in response to monitor events), but no further resources
      are started within the affected partition.
     </para>
     <para>
      This setting is recommended for clusters where certain resources
      depend on communication with other nodes (for example, OCFS2 mounts).
      In this case, the default setting
      <literal>no-quorum-policy=stop</literal> is not useful, as it would
      lead to the following scenario: stopping those resources would not be
      possible while the peer nodes are unreachable. Instead, an attempt to
      stop them would eventually time out and cause a <literal>stop
      failure</literal>, triggering escalated recovery and fencing.

 <sect2 xml:id="sec-ha-config-basics-global-stonith">
  <title>Global option <literal>stonith-enabled</literal></title>
  <para>
   This global option defines whether to apply fencing, allowing &stonith;
   devices to shoot failed nodes and nodes with resources that cannot be
   stopped. By default, this global option is set to
   <literal>true</literal>, because for normal cluster operation it is
   necessary to use &stonith; devices. According to the default value,
   the cluster will refuse to start any resources if no &stonith;
   resources have been defined.
  </para>
  <para>
   If you need to disable fencing for any reasons, set
   <literal>stonith-enabled</literal> to <literal>false</literal>, but be
   aware that this has impact on the support status for your product.
   Furthermore, with <literal>stonith-enabled="false"</literal>, resources
   like the Distributed Lock Manager (DLM) and all services depending on
   DLM (such as lvmlockd, GFS2, and OCFS2) will fail to start.
