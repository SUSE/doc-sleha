 <title>Configuration and Administration Basics</title>
 <info>
      <abstract>
        <para>
    The main purpose of an HA cluster is to manage user services. Typical
    examples of user services are an Apache Web server or a database. From
    the user's point of view, the services do something specific when
    ordered to do so. To the cluster, however, they are only resources which
    may be started or stopped&mdash;the nature of the service is
    irrelevant to the cluster.
   </para>
        <para>
    In this chapter, we will introduce some basic concepts you need to know
    when configuring resources and administering your cluster. The following
    chapters show you how to execute the main configuration and
    administration tasks with each of the management tools the &hasi;
    provides.

  <title>Cluster Resources</title>

  <para>
   As a cluster administrator, you need to create cluster resources for
   every resource or application you run on servers in your cluster. Cluster
   resources can include Web sites, e-mail servers, databases, file systems,
   virtual machines, and any other server-based applications or services you
   want to make available to users at all times.

<!--taroth 2010-02-23: fix for bnc#578583-->
   <para>
    Before you can use a resource in the cluster, it must be set up. For
    example, if you want to use an Apache server as a cluster resource, set
    up the Apache server first and complete the Apache configuration before
    starting the respective resource in your cluster.
   </para>
   <para>
    If a resource has specific environment requirements, make sure they are
    present and identical on all cluster nodes. This kind of configuration
    is not managed by the &hasi;. You must do this yourself.

   <note>
    <title>Do Not Touch Services Managed by the Cluster</title>
    <para>
     When managing a resource with the &hasi;, the same resource must not
     be started or stopped otherwise (outside of the cluster, for example
     manually or on boot or reboot). The &hasi; software is responsible
     for all service start or stop actions.

     If you need to execute testing or maintenance tasks after the services
     are already running under cluster control, make sure to put the
     resources, nodes, or the whole cluster into maintenance mode before you
     touch any of them manually. For details, see

   <title>Supported Resource Agent Classes</title>
   <para>
    For each cluster resource you add, you need to define the standard that
    the resource agent conforms to. Resource agents abstract the services
    they provide and present an accurate status to the cluster, which allows
    the cluster to be non-committal about the resources it manages. The
    cluster relies on the resource agent to react appropriately when given a
    start, stop or monitor command.
   </para>
   <para>
    Typically, resource agents come in the form of shell scripts. The
    &hasi; supports the following classes of resource agents:

     <listitem>
      <para>
       OCF RA agents are best suited for use with &ha;, especially when
       you need multi-state resources or special monitoring abilities. The
       agents are generally located in
       <filename>/usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/<replaceable>provider</replaceable>/</filename>.
       Their functionality is similar to that of LSB scripts. However, the
       configuration is always done with environmental variables which allow
       them to accept and process parameters easily. The OCF specification
       (as it relates to resource agents) can be found at
       <link xlink:href="http://www.opencf.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/specs/ra/resource-agent-api.txt?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup"/>.
       OCF specifications have strict definitions of which exit codes must
       be returned by actions, see <xref linkend="sec.ha.errorcodes"/>. The
       cluster follows these specifications exactly.
      </para>
      <para>
       All OCF Resource Agents are required to have at least the actions
       <literal>start</literal>, <literal>stop</literal>,
       <literal>status</literal>, <literal>monitor</literal>, and
       <literal>meta-data</literal>. The <literal>meta-data</literal> action
       retrieves information about how to configure the agent. For example,
       if you want to know more about the <literal>IPaddr</literal> agent by
       the provider <literal>heartbeat</literal>, use the following command:
      </para>
<screen>OCF_ROOT=/usr/lib/ocf /usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/heartbeat/IPaddr meta-data</screen>

       The output is information in XML format, including several sections

       LSB resource agents are generally provided by the operating
       system/distribution and are found in
       <filename>/etc/init.d</filename>. To be used with the cluster, they
       must conform to the LSB init script specification. For example, they
       must have several actions implemented, which are, at minimum,
       <literal>start</literal>, <literal>stop</literal>,
       <literal>restart</literal>, <literal>reload</literal>,
       <literal>force-reload</literal>, and <literal>status</literal>. For

      <para>
       The configuration of those services is not standardized. If you
       intend to use an LSB script with &ha;, make sure that you

       Generally the services (or unit files) are provided by the operating

    <title>Clones</title>
    <para>
     You may want certain resources to run simultaneously on multiple nodes
     in your cluster. To do this you must configure a resource as a clone.
     Examples of resources that might be configured as clones include
     cluster file systems like OCFS2. You can clone any
     resource provided. This is supported by the resource’s Resource
     Agent. Clone resources may even be configured differently depending on
     which nodes they are hosted.
    </para>
    <para>
     There are three types of resource clones:

    <variablelist>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>Anonymous Clones</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        These are the simplest type of clones. They behave identically
        anywhere they are running. Because of this, there can only be one
        instance of an anonymous clone active per machine.
       </para>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>Globally Unique Clones</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        These resources are distinct entities. An instance of the clone
        running on one node is not equivalent to another instance on another
        node; nor would any two instances on the same node be equivalent.

      <term>Stateful Clones (Multi-state Resources)</term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        Active instances of these resources are divided into two states,
        active and passive. These are also sometimes called primary and
        secondary, or master and slave. Stateful clones can be either
        anonymous or globally unique. See also

    The scripts of all resource classes can be given parameters which

    If your resource agent supports parameters, you can add them with the
    <command>crm_resource</command> command or with
<!--the GUI as described in
    <xref linkend="pro.ha.config.gui.parameters"/>. Alternatively, use-->
    &hawk2; as described in

<screen>Manages virtual IPv4 addresses (portable version) (ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr)
    
This script manages IP alias IP addresses
It can add an IP alias, or remove one.   
    
Parameters (* denotes required, [] the default):
    
ip* (string): IPv4 address
The IPv4 address to be configured in dotted quad notation, for example
"192.168.1.1".                                                        
    
nic (string, [eth0]): Network interface
The base network interface on which the IP address will be brought
online.                                                           
    
If left empty, the script will try and determine this from the    
routing table.                                                    
    
Do NOT specify an alias interface in the form eth0:1 or anything here;
rather, specify the base interface only.                              
    
cidr_netmask (string): Netmask
The netmask for the interface in CIDR format. (ie, 24), or in
dotted quad notation  255.255.255.0).                        
    
If unspecified, the script will also try to determine this from the
routing table.                                                     
    
broadcast (string): Broadcast address
Broadcast address associated with the IP. If left empty, the script will
determine this from the netmask.                                        
    
iflabel (string): Interface label
You can specify an additional label for your IP address here.
    
lvs_support (boolean, [false]): Enable support for LVS DR
Enable support for LVS Direct Routing configurations. In case a IP

      The CRM executes an initial monitoring for each resource on every
      node, the so-called <literal>probe</literal>. A probe is also executed
      after the cleanup of a resource. If multiple monitoring operations are
      defined for a resource, the CRM will select the one with the smallest
      interval and will use its timeout value as default timeout for
      probing. If no monitor operation is configured, the cluster-wide
      default applies. The default is <literal>20</literal> seconds (if not
      specified otherwise by configuring the <varname>op_defaults</varname>
      parameter). If you do not want to rely on the automatic calculation or
      the <systemitem>op_defaults</systemitem> value, define a specific
      monitoring operation for the <emphasis>probing</emphasis> of this
      resource. Do so by adding a monitoring operation with the
      <literal>interval</literal> set to <literal>0</literal>, for example:

     <title>Using Resource Sets for Defining Constraints</title>
     <para>
      As an alternative format for defining location, colocation or ordering
      constraints, you can use <literal>resource sets</literal>, where
      primitives are grouped together in one set. Previously this was
      possible either by defining a resource group (which could not always
      accurately express the design), or by defining each relationship as an
      individual constraint. The latter caused a constraint explosion as the
      number of resources and combinations grew. The configuration via
      resource sets is not necessarily less verbose, but is easier to
      understand and maintain, as the following examples show.
     </para>
     <example xml:id="ex.config.basic.resourceset.loc">
      <title>A Resource Set for Location Constraints</title>
      <para>
       For example, you can use the following configuration of a resource
       set (<varname>loc-&node1;</varname>) in the &crmsh; to place
       two virtual IPs (<varname>vip1</varname> and <varname>vip2</varname>)
       on the same node, <varname>&node1;</varname>:
      </para>

&prompt.crm.conf;<command>primitive</command> vip1 ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr2 params ip=&subnetI;.6
&prompt.crm.conf;<command>location</command> loc-&node1; { vip1 vip2 } inf: &node1; </screen>
     </example>
     <para>
      If you want to use resource sets to replace a configuration of
      colocation constraints, consider the following two examples:

  <sect2 xml:id="sec.ha.config.basics.constraints.scores">
   <title>Scores and Infinity</title>
   <para>
    When defining constraints, you also need to deal with scores. Scores of
    all kinds are integral to how the cluster works. Practically everything
    from migrating a resource to deciding which resource to stop in a
    degraded cluster is achieved by manipulating scores in some way. Scores
    are calculated on a per-resource basis and any node with a negative
    score for a resource cannot run that resource. After calculating the
    scores for a resource, the cluster then chooses the node with the
    highest score.
   </para>
   <para>
    <literal>INFINITY</literal> is currently deﬁned as
    <literal>1,000,000</literal>. Additions or subtractions with it stick to
    the following three basic rules:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>

      Any value + INFINITY = INFINITY
     </para>

     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
    When defining resource constraints, you specify a score for each
    constraint. The score indicates the value you are assigning to this
    resource constraint. Constraints with higher scores are applied before
    those with lower scores. By creating additional location constraints
    with different scores for a given resource, you can specify an order for
    the nodes that a resource will fail over to.

  <sect2 xml:id="sec.ha.config.basics.constraints.templates">

    If you have defined a resource template (see

    However, colocation constraints must not contain more than one reference

   </para>
<!--taroth 2011-11-23: https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=729634-->
   <para>
    Resource templates referenced in constraints stand for all primitives
    which are derived from that template. This means, the constraint applies
    to all primitive resources referencing the resource template.
    Referencing resource templates in constraints is an alternative to
    resource sets and can simplify the cluster configuration considerably.

   <para>
    A resource will be automatically restarted if it fails. If that cannot
    be achieved on the current node, or it fails <literal>N</literal> times
    on the current node, it will try to fail over to another node. Each time
    the resource fails, its failcount is raised. You can define a number of
    failures for resources (a <literal>migration-threshold</literal>), after
    which they will migrate to a new node. If you have more than two nodes
    in your cluster, the node a particular resource fails over to is chosen
    by the &ha; software.

     According to the RA, the "host_memory" way is for common use. Setting

  <title>Managing Services on Remote Hosts</title>

<!--fate#313717 (SP3)-->

  <para>
   The possibilities for monitoring and managing services on remote hosts
   has become increasingly important during the last few years.
   &productname; 11 SP3 offered fine-grained monitoring of services on
   remote hosts via monitoring plug-ins. The recent addition of the
   <literal>pacemaker_remote</literal> service now allows &productname;
   &productnumber; to fully manage and monitor resources on remote hosts
   just as if they were a real cluster node&mdash;without the need to
   install the cluster stack on the remote machines.
  </para>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec.ha.config.basics.remote.nagios">
   <title>Monitoring Services on Remote Hosts with Monitoring Plug-ins</title>
   <para>
    Monitoring of virtual machines can be done with the VM agent (which only
    checks if the guest shows up in the hypervisor), or by external scripts
    called from the VirtualDomain or Xen agent. Up to now, more fine-grained
    monitoring was only possible with a full setup of the &ha; stack
    within the virtual machines.
   </para>
   <para>
    By providing support for monitoring plug-ins (formerly named Nagios
    plug-ins), the &hasi; now also allows you to monitor services on
    remote hosts. You can collect external statuses on the guests without
    modifying the guest image. For example, VM guests might run Web services
    or simple network resources that need to be accessible. With the Nagios
    resource agents, you can now monitor the Web service or the network
    resource on the guest. In case these services are not reachable anymore,
    the &hasi; will trigger a restart or migration of the respective
    guest.
   </para>
   <para>
    If your guests depend on a service (for example, an NFS server to be
    used by the guest), the service can either be an ordinary resource,
    managed by the cluster, or an external service that is monitored with
    Nagios resources instead.
   </para>
   <para>
    To configure the Nagios resources, the following packages must be
    installed on the host:

    A typical use case is to configure the monitoring plug-ins as resources
    belonging to a resource container, which usually is a VM. The container
    will be restarted if any of its resources has failed. Refer to
    <xref linkend="ex.ha.nagios.config"/> for a configuration example.
    Alternatively, Nagios resource agents can also be configured as ordinary
    resources if you want to use them for monitoring hosts or services via
    the network.
