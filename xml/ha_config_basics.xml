      <abstract>
        <para>
    The main purpose of an HA cluster is to manage user services. Typical
    examples of user services are an Apache Web server or a database. From
    the user's point of view, the services do something specific when
    ordered to do so. To the cluster, however, they are only resources which
    may be started or stopped&mdash;the nature of the service is
    irrelevant to the cluster.
   </para>
        <para>
    In this chapter, we will introduce some basic concepts you need to know
    when configuring resources and administering your cluster. The following
    chapters show you how to execute the main configuration and
    administration tasks with each of the management tools the &hasi;
    provides.

  <title>Quorum determination</title>
  <para>
   Whenever communication fails between one or more nodes and the rest of the
   cluster, a cluster partition occurs. The nodes can only communicate with
   other nodes in the same partition and are unaware of the separated nodes.
   A cluster partition is defined as having quorum (being <quote>quorate</quote>)
   if it has the majority of nodes (or votes).
   How this is achieved is done by <emphasis>quorum calculation</emphasis>.
   Quorum is a requirement for fencing.
   </para>
   <para>
   Quorum calculation has changed between &productname;&nbsp;11 and
   &productname;&nbsp;15. For &productname;&nbsp;11, quorum was calculated by
   &pace;.
   Starting with &productname;&nbsp;12, &corosync; can handle quorum for
   two-node clusters directly without changing the &pace; configuration.
  </para>

  <para>How quorum is calculated is influenced by the following factors:</para>
   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry xml:id="vl-ha-config-basics-global-number-of-cluster-nodes">
     <term>Number of cluster nodes</term>
     <listitem>
         <para>To keep services running, a cluster with more than two nodes
       relies on quorum (majority vote) to resolve cluster partitions.
       Based on the following formula, you can calculate the minimum
       number of operational nodes required for the cluster to function:</para>
       <screen>N ≥ C/2 + 1

N = minimum number of operational nodes
C = number of cluster nodes</screen>
      <para>For example, a five-node cluster needs a minimum of three operational
       nodes (or two nodes which can fail). </para>
      <para>
       We strongly recommend to use either a two-node cluster or an odd number
       of cluster nodes.
       Two-node clusters make sense for stretched setups across two sites.
       Clusters with an odd number of nodes can either be built on one single
       site or might be spread across three sites.

       lead to the following scenario: Stopping those resources would not be
       possible while the peer nodes are unreachable. Instead, an attempt to

    Typically, resource agents come in the form of shell scripts. The
    &hasi; supports the following classes of resource agents:

     <term>Open Cluster Framework (OCF) resource agents</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       OCF RA agents are best suited for use with &ha;, especially when
       you need promotable clone resources or special monitoring abilities. The
       agents are generally located in
       <filename>/usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/<replaceable>provider</replaceable>/</filename>.
       Their functionality is similar to that of LSB scripts. However, the
       configuration is always done with environmental variables which allow
       them to accept and process parameters easily.
       OCF specifications have strict definitions of which exit codes must
       be returned by actions, see <xref linkend="sec-ha-errorcodes"/>. The
       cluster follows these specifications exactly.
      </para>
      <para>
       All OCF Resource Agents are required to have at least the actions
       <literal>start</literal>, <literal>stop</literal>,
       <literal>status</literal>, <literal>monitor</literal>, and
       <literal>meta-data</literal>. The <literal>meta-data</literal> action
       retrieves information about how to configure the agent. For example,
       to know more about the <literal>IPaddr</literal> agent by
       the provider <literal>heartbeat</literal>, use the following command:
      </para>
<screen>OCF_ROOT=/usr/lib/ocf /usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/heartbeat/IPaddr meta-data</screen>
      <para>
       The output is information in XML format, including several sections
       (general description, available parameters, available actions for the
       agent).

      <para>
       LSB resource agents are generally provided by the operating
       system/distribution and are found in
       <filename>/etc/init.d</filename>. To be used with the cluster, they
       must conform to the LSB init script specification. For example, they
       must have several actions implemented, which are, at minimum,
       <literal>start</literal>, <literal>stop</literal>,
       <literal>restart</literal>, <literal>reload</literal>,
       <literal>force-reload</literal>, and <literal>status</literal>. For

      <para>
       The configuration of those services is not standardized. If you
       intend to use an LSB script with &ha;, make sure that you
       understand how the relevant script is configured. Often you can find
       information about this in the documentation of the relevant package
       in

       Starting with &sle; 12, systemd is a replacement for the popular
       System V init daemon. Pacemaker can manage systemd services if they
       are present. Instead of init scripts, systemd has unit files.
       Generally the services (or unit files) are provided by the operating
       system. In case you want to convert existing init scripts, find more
       information at

       distributions) <literal>upstart</literal>. Therefore, Pacemaker
       supports a special alias which intelligently figures out which one
       applies to a given cluster node. This is particularly useful when the
       cluster contains a mix of systemd, upstart, and LSB services.
       Pacemaker will try to find the named service in the following order:
       as an LSB (SYS-V) init script, a systemd unit file, or an Upstart
       job.

    If you want to create lots of resources with similar configurations,
    defining a resource template is the easiest way. After having been

   <para>
    If a template is referenced in a primitive, the primitive will inherit
    all operations, instance attributes (parameters), meta attributes, and
    utilization attributes defined in the template. Additionally, you can
    define specific operations or attributes for your primitive. If any of
    these are defined in both the template and the primitive, the values
    defined in the primitive will take precedence over the ones defined in
    the template.

     Some cluster resources depend on other components or resources. They
     require that each component or resource starts in a specific order and
     runs together on the same server with resources it depends on. To
     simplify this configuration, you can use cluster resource groups.

      An example of a resource group would be a Web server that requires an
      IP address and a file system. In this case, each component is a
      separate resource that is combined into a cluster resource group. The
      resource group would run on one or more servers. In case of a software
      or hardware malfunction, the group would fail over to another server

     You may want certain resources to run simultaneously on multiple nodes

     Examples of resources that might be configured as clones include
     cluster file systems like OCFS2. You can clone any

   <para>
    The scripts of all resource classes can be given parameters which
    determine how they behave and which instance of a service they control.
    If your resource agent supports parameters, you can add them with the
    <command>crm_resource</command> command or with
<!--the GUI as described in
    <xref linkend="pro-ha-config-gui-parameters"/>. Alternatively, use-->
    &hawk2; as described in
    <xref linkend="pro-conf-hawk2-primitive-add"/>. In the
    <command>crm</command> command line utility and in &hawk2;, instance
    attributes are called <literal>params</literal> or
    <literal>Parameter</literal>, respectively. The list of instance
    attributes supported by an OCF script can be found by executing the
    following command as &rootuser;:
   </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;<command>crm</command> ra info <replaceable>[class:[provider:]]resource_agent</replaceable></screen>

    or (without the optional parts):

    The output lists all the supported attributes, their purpose and default

    For example, the command

<screen>Manages virtual IPv4 addresses (portable version) (ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr)
    
This script manages IP alias IP addresses
It can add an IP alias, or remove one.   
    
Parameters (* denotes required, [] the default):
    
ip* (string): IPv4 address
The IPv4 address to be configured in dotted quad notation, for example
"192.168.1.1".                                                        
    
nic (string, [eth0]): Network interface
The base network interface on which the IP address will be brought
online.                                                           
    
If left empty, the script will try and determine this from the    
routing table.                                                    
    
Do NOT specify an alias interface in the form eth0:1 or anything here;
rather, specify the base interface only.                              
    
cidr_netmask (string): Netmask
The netmask for the interface in CIDR format. (ie, 24), or in
dotted quad notation  255.255.255.0).                        
    
If unspecified, the script will also try to determine this from the
routing table.                                                     
    
broadcast (string): Broadcast address
Broadcast address associated with the IP. If left empty, the script will
determine this from the netmask.                                        
    
iflabel (string): Interface label
You can specify an additional label for your IP address here.
    
lvs_support (boolean, [false]): Enable support for LVS DR
Enable support for LVS Direct Routing configurations. In case a IP
address is stopped, only move it to the loopback device to allow the
local node to continue to service requests, but no longer advertise it
on the network.                                                       
    
local_stop_script (string): 
Script called when the IP is released
    
local_start_script (string): 
Script called when the IP is added
    
ARP_INTERVAL_MS (integer, [500]): milliseconds between gratuitous ARPs
milliseconds between ARPs                                         
    
ARP_REPEAT (integer, [10]): repeat count
How many gratuitous ARPs to send out when bringing up a new address
    
ARP_BACKGROUND (boolean, [yes]): run in background
run in background (no longer any reason to do this)
    
ARP_NETMASK (string, [ffffffffffff]): netmask for ARP
netmask for ARP - in nonstandard hexadecimal format.
    
Operations' defaults (advisory minimum):
    
start         timeout=90
stop          timeout=100
monitor_0     interval=5s timeout=20s</screen>

    Getting timeout values right is very important. Setting them too low

     <para>
      If stopping the resource also fails (for example, because the timeout
      for stopping is set too low), the cluster will fence the node. It
      considers the node where this happens to be out of control.

    You can adjust the global default for operations and set any specific

     <para>
      The CRM executes an initial monitoring for each resource on every
      node, the so-called <literal>probe</literal>. A probe is also executed
      after the cleanup of a resource. If multiple monitoring operations are
      defined for a resource, the CRM will select the one with the smallest
      interval and will use its timeout value as default timeout for
      probing. If no monitor operation is configured, the cluster-wide
      default applies. The default is <literal>20</literal> seconds (if not
      specified otherwise by configuring the <varname>op_defaults</varname>
      parameter). If you do not want to rely on the automatic calculation or
      the <systemitem>op_defaults</systemitem> value, define a specific
      monitoring operation for the <emphasis>probing</emphasis> of this
      resource. Do so by adding a monitoring operation with the
      <literal>interval</literal> set to <literal>0</literal>, for example:

      As an alternative format for defining location, colocation or ordering
      constraints, you can use <literal>resource sets</literal>, where
      primitives are grouped together in one set. Previously this was
      possible either by defining a resource group (which could not always

      individual constraint. The latter caused a constraint explosion as the
      number of resources and combinations grew. The configuration via
      resource sets is not necessarily less verbose, but is easier to
      understand and maintain, as the following examples show.

   <title>Scores and infinity</title>
   <para>
    When defining constraints, you also need to deal with scores. Scores of
    all kinds are integral to how the cluster works. Practically everything
    from migrating a resource to deciding which resource to stop in a
    degraded cluster is achieved by manipulating scores in some way. Scores
    are calculated on a per-resource basis and any node with a negative
    score for a resource cannot run that resource. After calculating the
    scores for a resource, the cluster then chooses the node with the
    highest score.

   <para>
    <literal>INFINITY</literal> is currently deﬁned as

   <para>
    When defining resource constraints, you specify a score for each
    constraint. The score indicates the value you are assigning to this
    resource constraint. Constraints with higher scores are applied before
    those with lower scores. By creating additional location constraints
    with different scores for a given resource, you can specify an order for
    the nodes that a resource will fail over to.

    If you have defined a resource template (see

    to a template. Resource sets must not contain a reference to a template.
   </para>

    Resource templates referenced in constraints stand for all primitives
    which are derived from that template. This means, the constraint applies

   <title>Placing resources based on their load impact</title>
   <para>
    Not all resources are equal. Some, such as &xen; guests, require that
    the node hosting them meets their capacity requirements. If resources
    are placed such that their combined need exceed the provided capacity,
    the resources diminish in performance (or even fail).

    A node is considered eligible for a resource if it has sufficient free
    capacity to satisfy the resource's requirements. The nature of the
    capacities is completely irrelevant for the &hasi;; it only makes
    sure that all capacity requirements of a resource are satisfied before
    moving a resource to a node.
   </para>
   <para>
    To manually configure the resource's requirements and the capacity a
    node provides, use utilization attributes. You can name the utilization
    attributes according to your preferences and define as many name/value
    pairs as your configuration needs. However, the attribute's values must
    be integers.
   </para>
   <para>
    If multiple resources with utilization attributes are grouped or have
    colocation constraints, the &hasi; takes that into account. If
    possible, the resources will be placed on a node that can fulfill
    <emphasis>all</emphasis> capacity requirements.
   </para>
   <note>
    <title>Utilization attributes for groups</title>
    <para>
     It is impossible to set utilization attributes directly for a resource
     group. However, to simplify the configuration for a group, you can add
     a utilization attribute with the total capacity needed to any of the
     resources in the group.
    </para>
   </note>
   <para>
    The &hasi; also provides means to detect and configure both node
    capacity and resource requirements automatically:
   </para>
   <para>
    The <systemitem>NodeUtilization</systemitem> resource agent checks the
    capacity of a node (regarding CPU and RAM).
    To configure automatic detection, create a clone resource of the
    following class, provider, and type:
    <literal>ocf:pacemaker:NodeUtilization</literal>. One instance of the
    clone should be running on each node. After the instance has started, a
    utilization section will be added to the node's configuration in CIB.
   </para>
   <para>
    For automatic detection of a resource's minimal requirements (regarding
    RAM and CPU) the <systemitem>Xen</systemitem> resource agent has been
    improved. Upon start of a <systemitem>Xen</systemitem> resource, it will
    reflect the consumption of RAM and CPU. Utilization attributes will
    automatically be added to the resource configuration.
   </para>
   <note>
    <title>Different resource agents for &xen; and libvirt</title>
    <para>
     The <systemitem>ocf:heartbeat:Xen</systemitem> resource agent should not be

   <para>
    Apart from detecting the minimal requirements, the &hasi; also allows
    to monitor the current utilization via the
    <systemitem>VirtualDomain</systemitem> resource agent. It detects CPU
    and RAM use of the virtual machine. To use this feature, configure a
    resource of the following class, provider and type:
    <literal>ocf:heartbeat:VirtualDomain</literal>. The following instance
    attributes are available: <varname>autoset_utilization_cpu</varname> and

    Independent of manually or automatically configuring capacity and

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-ha-config-basics-tags">
   <title>Grouping resources by using tags</title>
   <para>
    Tags are a new feature that has been added to Pacemaker recently. Tags
    are a way to refer to multiple resources at once, without creating any
    colocation or ordering relationship between them. This can be useful for
    grouping conceptually related resources. For example, if you have
    several resources related to a database, create a tag called
    <literal>databases</literal> and add all resources related to the
    database to this tag. This allows you to stop or start them all with a
    single command.
   </para>
   <para>
    Tags can also be used in constraints. For example, the following
    location constraint <literal>loc-db-prefer</literal> applies to the set
    of resources tagged with <literal>databases</literal>:

  <title>Managing services on remote hosts</title>

 <para>
   The possibilities for monitoring and managing services on remote hosts
   has become increasingly important during the last few years.
   &productname; 11 SP3 offered fine-grained monitoring of services on
   remote hosts via monitoring plug-ins. The recent addition of the
   <literal>pacemaker_remote</literal> service now allows &productname;
   &productnumber; to fully manage and monitor resources on remote hosts
   just as if they were a real cluster node&mdash;without the need to
   install the cluster stack on the remote machines.
  </para>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-ha-config-basics-remote-nagios">
   <title>Monitoring services on remote hosts with monitoring plug-ins</title>
   <para>
    Monitoring of virtual machines can be done with the VM agent (which only
    checks if the guest shows up in the hypervisor), or by external scripts
    called from the VirtualDomain or Xen agent. Up to now, more fine-grained
    monitoring was only possible with a full setup of the &ha; stack
    within the virtual machines.
   </para>
   <para>
    By providing support for monitoring plug-ins (formerly named Nagios
    plug-ins), the &hasi; now also allows you to monitor services on
    remote hosts. You can collect external statuses on the guests without
    modifying the guest image. For example, VM guests might run Web services
    or simple network resources that need to be accessible. With the Nagios
    resource agents, you can now monitor the Web service or the network
    resource on the guest. In case these services are not reachable anymore,
    the &hasi; will trigger a restart or migration of the respective
    guest.
   </para>
   <para>
    If your guests depend on a service (for example, an NFS server to be
    used by the guest), the service can either be an ordinary resource,
    managed by the cluster, or an external service that is monitored with
    Nagios resources instead.
   </para>
   <para>
    To configure the Nagios resources, the following packages must be
    installed on the host:

   <para>
    &yast; or Zypper will resolve any dependencies on further packages,
    if required.
   </para>
   <para>
    A typical use case is to configure the monitoring plug-ins as resources
    belonging to a resource container, which usually is a VM. The container
    will be restarted if any of its resources has failed. Refer to
    <xref linkend="ex-ha-nagios-config"/> for a configuration example.
    Alternatively, Nagios resource agents can also be configured as ordinary
    resources to use them for monitoring hosts or services via the network.
