 <title>Distributed Lock Manager (DLM)</title>
 <info>
  <abstract>
   <para>
    The Distributed Lock Manager (DLM) coordinates disk access for clustered
    file systems. It administers file locking to increase performance and
    availability. The DLM in the kernel is the base component used by &ocfs;,
    GFS2, Cluster MD, and &clvm; (lvmlockd) to provide active-active
    storage at each respective layer.

  <title>Protocols for DLM Communication</title>

  <para>
   DLM can either use the TCP or SCTP protocol for communication. You can specify
   which protocol to use by setting the <parameter>protocol</parameter> option
   in the DLM configuration file <filename>/etc/dlm/dlm.conf</filename>. If network
   device bonding cannot be used for any reason, the second best choice is to
   define a redundant communication channel (a second ring) in &corosync;. If
   you have configured redundant communication rings in &corosync.conf;, DLM
   will automatically use SCTP. Using the TCP protocol for DLM communication is
   not supported in clusters with two redundant communication rings in
   &corosync.conf;.
<!--However, if you want DLM to use TCP for
   communication, disable <guimenu>rrp_mode</guimenu> by setting it to
   <literal>none</literal>. For details on configuring a redundant
   communication channel in &corosync; and setting <guimenu>rrp_mode</guimenu>,
   see <xref linkend="pro.ha.installation.setup.channel2"/>.-->

  <title>Configuring DLM Cluster Resources</title>

  <para>
   DLM uses the cluster membership services from &pace; which run in user
   space. Therefore, DLM needs to be configured as clone resource that is
   present on each node in the cluster.
  </para>

  <note>
   <title>DLM Resource for Several Solutions</title>
   <para>
    As &ocfs;, GFS2, Cluster MD, and &clvm; (lvmlockd) all use DLM, it is
    enough to configure one resource for DLM. As the DLM resource runs on all
    nodes in the cluster it is configured as a clone resource.
   </para>
   <para>
    If you have a setup that includes both &ocfs; and &clvm;, configuring
    <emphasis>one</emphasis> DLM resource for both &ocfs; and &clvm; is enough.
   </para>

   <title>Configuring a Base Group for DLM</title>
   <para>
    The configuration consists of a base group that includes several primitives
    and a base clone. Both base group and base clone can be used in various
    scenarios afterward (for both &ocfs; and &clvm;, for example). You only need
    to extended the base group with the respective primitives as needed. As the
    base group has internal colocation and ordering, this simplifies the
    overall setup as you do not need to specify several individual groups,
    clones and their dependencies.
   </para>
   <para>
    Follow the steps below on one node in the cluster:
   </para>
   <step>
    <para>
     Start a shell and log in as &rootuser; or equivalent.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Run <command>crm</command> <option>configure</option>.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Enter the following to create the primitive resource for DLM:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.crm.conf;<command>primitive</command> dlm ocf:pacemaker:controld \
  op monitor interval="60" timeout="60"</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Create a base group for the DLM resource and further storage-related
     resources:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.crm.conf;<command>group</command> g-storage dlm</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Clone the <literal>g-storage</literal> group so that it runs on all nodes:
    </para>
<screen>&prompt.crm.conf; <command>clone</command> cl-storage g-storage \
  meta interleave=true target-role=Started</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Review your changes with <command>show</command>.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     If everything is correct, submit your changes with
     <command>commit</command> and leave the crm live configuration with
     <command>exit</command>.
    </para>
   </step>

   <title>Failure When Disabling &stonith;</title>
   <para>
    Clusters without &stonith; are not supported. If you set the global cluster
    option <varname>stonith-enabled</varname> to <literal>false</literal> for
    testing or troubleshooting purposes, the DLM resource and all services
    depending on it (such as &clvm;, GFS2, and OCFS2) will fail to start.
